          <h2>Design</h2>
          Every business needs a logo. If you have an existing business, it may be a good time for you 
          to consider updating your brand image with a new logo. 
          Most of our web design clients do advertising of some kind, 
          and we have the capability to design those banner ads used online, magazine ads, billboards, 
          or any other type of advertising. 
          We have packages that include things like a website, logo, brochures, etc.

          <h2>Development</h2>
          Your custom website we successfully designed  needs additional service at some point. 
          Even if the website is built with a content management system (like WordPress) 
          that allows the client to easily add and manage the content on their own, 
          there will still be some maintenance needed at some point. We offer ongoing maintenance 
          after a web design project in a few different ways. We charge an hourly rate for 
          whatever worth you need. We also offer you a package and charge a monthly retainer. 
          The package has a flat monthly fee, and the client is entitled to priority support and 
          a specific number of hours of work each month.
